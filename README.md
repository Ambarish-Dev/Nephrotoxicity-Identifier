# Nephrotoxicity-Identifier
This is a software system for analyzing kidney tissue slide images and identifying various types of damage caused by venom concentrations or any type of variation, involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of how you could use this system :

  # Image Preprocessing:
        Read the stained slide images.
        Preprocess the images to enhance contrast, remove noise, and normalize the brightness to ensure consistency across images.

  # Segmentation:
        Segment the kidney tissue regions from the rest of the image. This can be done using techniques like thresholding, edge detection, or machine learning-based segmentation algorithms.
        Divide the kidney tissue into different regions of interest (ROIs) such as glomeruli, tubules, and interstitium.

  # Feature Extraction:
        Extract relevant features from the segmented ROIs to characterize different types of damage. These features also include texture features, shape features, intensity-based features, etc.
        Features  are extracted using methods like Haralick texture features, morphological operations, and deep learning-based feature extraction (will be implemented in later generations).

  # Classification:
        Train a classifier to classify the extracted features into different categories of damage (e.g., basement membrane degradation, vacuolization, change in glomerular size).
        You can also use external machine learning algorithms with this unit such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or deep learning-based classifiers for this purpose.
        Ensure that you have labeled data for training your classifier, which has to be obtained by manual annotation of images.

  # Quantification:
        Once the regions of damage are identified, quantify the extent of damage in each region. This could involve counting the number of damaged areas, measuring the area of damage relative to the total area of the tissue, or assessing the severity of damage based on intensity levels.

  # Reporting:
        Generate a detailed report for each sample, indicating the types of damage present and their respective quantifications.
        Provide visualizations such as heatmaps or annotated images to illustrate the distribution and severity of damage within the kidney tissue.

  # Validation and Iteration:
        Validate the performance of your software using a separate set of labeled images not used during training.
        Iterate on the software to improve its accuracy and robustness based on feedback from validation results.

  # User Interface:
        Gives you a starter level user-friendly interface to upload images, view analysis results, and generate reports.

  # Deployment:
        Deploy the software for use.
